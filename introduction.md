### What is a Table?
| player_id | name | country | goals |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| 101 | Sam | USA | 6 |
| 103 | Daniel | England | 7 |
| 104 | Anthony | France | 10 |
| 102 | Bruno | Sweden | 6 |
| 105 | Alex | Wales | 5 |
| 106 | Matt | Scotland | 3 |

This is how a table looks like in a database. The headers i.e. player_id, name, country and goals are also known as fields of a database. Then we have columns and rows in a table as we all know. Here each row represents a record or a tuple.

So you can use sql commands to query, update and insert records to your table.
